To get this to work you have to 
1) have a link here, called cgi-bin, to this cgi-bin directory itself.
	$ ln -s . cgi-bin
2) invoke the web server here, in this cgi-bin directory, since awki.cgi expects cgi-bin to be the root path
	$ python -m CGIHTTPServer 8080
3) use web client to access http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/awki.cgi
	(if web server is started from parent directory root path
	is not what awki.cgi wants-- it wants root to be cgi-bin.
	Conversely, some clients (safari) won't run a cgi from the
	URL bar unless it is preceeded by cgi-bin/.)

NEVER MIND:
Created index.html file which automatically invokes awki.cgi. When python is run from the same directory as the index.html, accessing URL
	http://localhost:8080
 from the web client will pull in that index.html file, which then invokes awki.cgi automatically.

Contents of index.html file:

<META http-equiv=Refresh Content="0; Url=cgi-bin/awki.cgi">
