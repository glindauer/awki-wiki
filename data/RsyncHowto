FILE (with filenames of files to exclude) has one pattern per line;
lines starting with # or ;, and blank lines, are ignored.
1. Patterns starting with / are absolute path names (RELATIVE TO WINDOWS_DIR!).
2. Patterns not starting with / are matched to the end of the pathname.
3. Patterns ending with a / only match a directory, not a file, link, or device.
4. * matches a single file or directory name (it stops at slashes)
5. ** matches anything, including slashes.
6. ? matches any character except a slash (/).
7. [ introduces a class like [a-z] or [[:alpha:]]
8. (\) is matched literally UNLESS it precedes a *, ?, or [
 Windows files that should be excluded include:
hiberfil.sys
pagefile.sys
Windows/temp/*
