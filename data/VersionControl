;1 Version Control with git
;2 Initial setup
,# At the project's root directory, set up git for the first (and only) time with 
 ;=git init
,# Then add in all the files you want under revisioning control with the add method
 ,=git add file1 file2 filewildcard.*
,# Finally, commit your changes
 ,=git commit -m "Type in a present tense explanation of the changes"

;2 What to do to log any changes
After making changes, use one of these
,* To add the latest version of just one file, use
 git add filename
,* or, to add all the files, from the project root directory use
 git add .
,* or, if you aren't in the root directory I think this works (need to check)
 git add --all

You still have to commit with
 git commit -m "Use a good description!"

;2 How to see past changes
,* To briefly view the changes (and the places you can return to) at any time, use
 git log
,* To see what files changed with the commits, use
 git log --stat
,* To see the actual changes in the files, use
 git log -p
,* For a really brief look:
 git log --pretty
