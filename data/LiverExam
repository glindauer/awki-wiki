;2 Summary of Techniques 
,*Palpation
,=Start palpating in the right lower quadrant at the midclavicular line as the patient inhales and continue cephalad until the liver edge is palpated. 
,*Percussion
,=Percuss starting at the third rib space in the midclavicular line and continue caudally until dullness is noted. 
,*Scratch test
,=Place stethoscope above the costal margin in the midclavicular line. Starting in the right lower quadrant, move finger cephalad while scratching the abdomen. The point where sound enhancement is heard defines the lower liver edge.

;2 Scratch Test Procedure

The scratch test is performed by marking a point on
the right costal margin at the midclavicular line (point A
in Figure). This point was used as a reference to take
the measurements of liver span below the costal margin.
The diaphragm of the stethoscope was placed on the
xiphisternum (point C in Figure). Light transverse
strokes of the skin with a single finger, parallel to the
suspected liver edge, were made advancing from the
right lower quadrant along the midclavicular line to the
costal margin. When the hepatic edge was reached
(point B1 in Figure), the scratching sound was transmitted
through the solid liver with the resultant sudden
increase in auscultated sound intensity; the sound intensity
continued to increase until it was maximal (point
B2) and this point was taken as the best estimate of the
liver edge. The distance between this point and point A
(distance AB2) was recorded on a data sheet. The
sonographers used the same reference point to measure
distance to the liver edge (Point A).

At midclavicular line, liver span should be 2.5" to 4.75"  (6-12 cm), which is pinky, ring, and middle finger width to just less than palm width.
