;2 Clonezilla for windows maintenance:

At a prompt, use "sudo su -" to obtain root privilege. Then you can use parted, etc.

;3 Command line tools under clonezilla:
fdisk -l to list all partitions (like diskutil list on osx)
gdisk /dev/sd? is like osx gpt, get sd? from fdisk -l

;3 Cloning a windows MBR disk using clonezilla
Use clonezilla to clone to a disk SOLELY used for WINDOWS. Don't bother trying to use clonezilla to clone to an external partition formatted GPT for MAC use-- it will want to trash the hold external drive, it won't let you just pick an NTFS or FAT partition on that drive.

Likewise, using clonezilla to copy to an image requires different formatting than available.

Currently trying Disk Utility; highlight the partition in question; "New Image"; chose output as DVD/CD image.

;2 MBR vs. GPT:

A GPT windows partition will only boot if using UEFI-- macbook uses the original EFI standard and windows will not boot from a GPT partition with that standard. You can convert GPT to MBR (to allow windows to boot) using the r option of gdisk at the clonezilla command prompt (see GdiskAndGPT).

If, on a Windows MBR partition clonezilla complains "This disk contains mismatched GPT and MBR partition:"
and doesn't run, go ahead and use
 # sgdisk -z /dev/sd?
to zap the GPT partition table, leaving the MBR, then re-run clonezilla. (Presumably on a disk which MAC tools had previously be run on...)
