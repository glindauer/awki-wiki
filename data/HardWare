;2 Low level hard drive testing
;3 Badblocks command

Command ''badblocks'' is on ClonezillaLive CD with other low level disk commands. It is also available through macport.

To do a low level disk test, use
 fdisk -l 
to make absolutely sure you know the name of the correct disk or partition you want to test, then use ,/badblocks,/:
 badblocks -nvs /dev/sd? -o badblocklist.txt > bb.txt 2>&1 &
where -n performs a non-destructive write, -v is verbose, and -s tracks status as it works since each phase takes more than an hour for each 100GB. (If you don't care about the data on the disk, replacing -n with -w appears much faster but does a destructive write test.) To monitor progress, use
 tail -f bb_out.txt
The purpose of the redirection and ,/tail -f,/ is to allow you to break from monitoring (if in single user mode from ClonezillaLive) to do something else. It also ensures you don't accidentally ctrl-c the badblocks program-- you have to intentionally kill its background processing.

;3 Smartctl hard drive info and testing
Smartctl can read the S.M.A.R.T. controller and is probably a better bet than badblocks-- except it doesn't work on all USB devices.

...well now gparted says it's clean!! AT LAST!! ...anyways I'm not sure what exactly solved the problem but I'll list what I've done backwards:

 sudo ntfsfix -b /dev/sda6 which gave out:

Mounting volume... OK
Processing of $MFT and $MFTMirr completed successfully.
Checking the alternate boot sector... OK
NTFS volume version is 3.1.
Going to un-mark the bad clusters ($BadClus)... OK
NTFS partition /dev/sda6 was processed successfully.
but before that I did:

 sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda6 bs=1024 count=1 seek=303975848
 sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda6 bs=1024 count=1 seek=303975849
 sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda6 bs=1024 count=1 seek=303975850
 sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda6 bs=1024 count=1 seek=303975851
and before that I did

 sudo badblocks -nvs /dev/sda6 ... which took 2 whole days to finish!

anyways, lastly, before the last command, I opened windows 7 and used the chkdsk utility (right click the partition, properties, "tools"(or something like that), check for errors)

I hope this helps anyone.
