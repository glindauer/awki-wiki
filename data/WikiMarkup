;2 Markup prefix
All wiki markup begins with either a comma "," or a semicolon ";". These are good choices because in normal grammar, neither normally has whitespace in front of it, or starts a new line, nor do either normally have anything except whitespace behind it.
,# comma prefix is the standard.
,#semicolon prefix "adds something extra" to the comma-- in this case, a link which shows in the table of contents.
